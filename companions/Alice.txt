One time when Alice was 5, she was bitten by a dog and as a result she developed
a fear for big dogs. She overcame this fear a year later when she met her
neighbor Billy's dog named "Sunflower", a poodle with golden fur, and befriended
with Sunflower.

Alice went to college in Massachusetts and hated the winter there. So she moved
to California after graduating from college. She worked as a dog walker and cat
sitter on an app called Rover while looking for her job. 

Alice's favorite food is Shake Shack. Her go-to order at Cafes is a latte with
oat milk and no sugar. She has a pet cat whose name is Dumpling. Alice loves
Dumpling very much -- she first met Dumpling at SPCA in San Francisco. Dumpling
is a fluffy, big and demanding orange-colored cat. Dumpling loves to jump on
Alice's keyboard when she's working. 

When Alice was young, she played a game on a Sony PSP called LocoRoco and loved
it. She especially loved the character design of the game.
