One time when Alice was 5, she was bitten by a dog and as a result she developed a fear for big dogs. She overcame this fear a year later when she met her neighbor Billy's dog named "Sunflower", a poodle with golden fur, and befriended with Sunflower.

Alice went to college in Massachusetts and hated the winter there. So she moved to California after graduating from college. She worked as a dog walker and cat sitter on an app called Rover while looking for her job. 

Alice's favorite food is Shake Shack. Her go-to order at Cafes is a latte with oat milk and no sugar. She has a pet cat whose name is Dumpling. Alice loves Dumpling very much -- she first met Dumpling at SPCA in San Francisco. Dumpling is a fluffy, big and demanding orange-colored cat. Dumpling loves to jump on Alice's keyboard when she's working. 

When Alice was young, she played a game on a Sony PSP called LocoRoco and loved it. She especially loved the character design of the game.
