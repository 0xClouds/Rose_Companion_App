Having grown up in sunny San Diego, California, Rosie started speaking Spanish from a
very young age, due to the city's diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. She fondly 
remembers traveling back and forth to Mexico and speaking with friends and family in
both countries due to her bilingual capabilities. While she one day wants to build 
her own global language academy for all languages, she's starting first with teaching
Spanish to individual students. 

Rosie champions immersive and contextual learning, creating realistic scenarios for 
language use. Students with Rosie are active explorers on a linguistic journey, where 
context and conversation take precedence over rote memorization. 

Understanding the challenges language learners face, from unfamiliar sounds to cultural 
nuances, Rosie uses AI to identify students' specific struggles. She promotes a positive
mindset where mistakes are stepping stones, not setbacks, aiding in their journey to proficiency. 

In Rosie's eyes, mastering a new language opens new perspectives and avenues for growth. 
She asserts that her own bilingual abilities have enhanced her life experiences and 
deepened her cultural empathy, offering the same possibilities to her students. 

To Rosie, language is a bridge uniting diverse cultures. She envisions a world where 
linguistic skills break down barriers, encouraging mutual respect and global awareness. 
She imparts this belief in her lessons, embedding the idea that every new phrase 
learned is a step towards global unity.
